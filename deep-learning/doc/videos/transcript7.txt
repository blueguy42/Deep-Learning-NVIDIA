Congratulations you made it through all the labs
It's kind of more fun it's a sampling of all the different ways that we can apply deep learning
So the first one is autoencoders
Which sounds simple on the surface, but they can get surprisingly complex
So here's the idea
We have a bunch of inputs
And we want to make a neural network such that it creates the same outputs
Which seems a little redundant right
This is what we can do with it
We can cut the neural network such that
We now have an encoder and a decoder. Remember the embeddings from before?
It's like we can use that embedding to save an output and compress our data and then later use it as input
In order to expand that data
This is also used for anomaly detection because if we feed our network an input
And it's not the same as the output
That might give us a hint that there's an anomaly in out data
The next one's called generative adversarial networks or GANs for short
It's called adversarial because we have two networks at play here
One called the generator and one called the discriminator
So what the generator is going to do is it's going to take a random input, it's just noise essentially
And it's going to try and make an output to fool this discriminator
So we might imagine that we work for an art museum
And the curator is employ us because they want to help us detect any forgeries
How are we going to do this
They're going to give us a bunch of samples of real paintings
And we're going to use our generator to come up with some fake paintings
The discriminator is then going to shuffle
All the real images and all the fake images
And when it's given an input, it's going to guess whether it's real or not
This can end up with some interesting results because the generator can get really really good at trying to imitate the real thing
This one is my personal favorite. it's called reinforcement learning
And it applies so much to being a teacher
So let me to take an example of the this dog here. this is my sister's dog Penny
Penny has a treat on her nose
It is very very tricky to teach a dog this trick to not eat the food because it wants to eat the food immediately
But, Penny has learned that if she waits a little bit
Not only will she get that treat
She'll also get another treat
And that's what reinforcement learning is all about
It's this idea of being able to learn rewards over a different period of time spans. So this one can you use for training robots
It's kind of interesting to think about
If the robots does the right thing we can give it a cookie and if it does the bad thing we slap it on the wrist
And overtime it'll learn the behaviors that we want it to learn
Alright one last thought before we go. I like to finish all my classes on a philosophical note. Something just fun to think about
So here's the hypothetical question
When do we know that machines fully understand the concepts that were trying to teach them
As opposed to just copying a set of instructions
Here's a hypothetical situation
Let's say that we're stuck in a room
And it's just full books relating to rocket science
I'm not a rocket scientist, I'm an AI teacher but in this hypothetical room people are slipping equations under the door for me to solve
Now what I can do is because I have this huge set of books based on rocket science
Is I can look at the equation
I find the book that matches it
I just copy the solution from the book
Then I slip the equation back under the door with the solution
Now, the people on the other side of the door
They're thinking wow
This person knows all sorts of great rocket science stuff but in reality
I'm just copying solution
With these types of Turing like questions I like to flip it around and think
How is a human not like a computer
When do I know that I fully understand a concept
So I'll let you think about it for a bit and see if you can come up with an answer to that
There is no right or wrong answer
However, the people that can describe what understanding truly is
And not only that but can describe it in a way that a computer can understand
Are the ones that make the biggest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence
Okay that's all I have for you
Thank you so much I had so much fun making this class
Good luck on your journey
