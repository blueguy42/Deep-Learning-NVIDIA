# Deep Learning NVIDIA
 
This repo is an archive on the exploration based on the self-paced courses:
* <b><a href="https://courses.nvidia.com/courses/course-v1:DLI+T-FX-01+V1/about">Building a Brain in 10 Minutes!</a></b>
* <b><a href="https://courses.nvidia.com/courses/course-v1:DLI+S-FX-01+V1/about">Getting Started with Deep Learning</a></b>  

by the <b>NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute</b>.

To model the neural network, TensorFlow with Keras and Pandas is used.

The Jupyter notebooks are run using JupyterLab on an Amazon AWS Cloud machine with specifications:
* NVIDIA V100 GPU
* CUDA 10.1 with driver version 418.67
* Ubuntu 16.04
* Docker 18.03.1-ce
